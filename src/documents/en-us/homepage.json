    "description": "JAMstack technologies I use to push your business forward. Until recently, creating dynamic websites with tools like Wordpress was common practice. Compared to modern technologies though, today this approach oftentimes seems inflexible and clunky, especially regarding the performance of the resulting website. Javascript libraries like React and modern Front End Frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby allow for the creation of static assets (or server side rendering) with all the possibilities dynamic web apps offer. So you'll get the best of both worlds. That entails a range of advantages, especially regarding the performance, the flexibility, the security, the scalability and the costs of the resulting website. All while content creators - through the integration of a Headless CMS like Prismic or Contentful - have the possibility, to flexibly adjust all of the content based on their requirements.",
